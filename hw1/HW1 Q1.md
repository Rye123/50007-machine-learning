# 1. Classification
## a.)
No such classifier exists.

![HW1Q1 Diagram](HW1Q1a%20Diagram.png)

As seen from the diagram, since the positive example $(-1,-1)$ and negative example $(1,-1)$ are equidistant from the origin, there is no possible $r$ that will result in either example being on the inside or outside of an origin-centred circle with radius $r$.

## b.)
No such classifier exists.

Since negative examples $(1, -1)$ and $(-2, 2)$ lie on the same line $y=-x$ through the origin, it is impossible to obtain a $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that both negative examples appear on the same side of the decision boundary.
