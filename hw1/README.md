Submission for Homework 1.
- `HW1 Instructions.pdf` contains the questions for the assignment.
- `data/` contains the data given as part of the questions.
- `HW1 Q1.pdf` and `HW1 Q2-Q4.ipynb` contain the respective solutions.

## Running the Code
`HW1 Q2-Q4.ipynb` is arranged such that each question can be run separate from each other. However, within a question, code is likely to depend on preceding code -- hence it is best to run code blocks **in order**, at least within a question.

These two libraries are needed:
- Numpy, for calculating of matrices and vectors (Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Matplotlib, for plotting graphs (Q3, Q4)

The `data/` folder is **needed**, as the code depends on data within the folder.
